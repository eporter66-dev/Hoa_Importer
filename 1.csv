The input appears to be a base64-encoded string. I'll decode it for you.

Here is the decoded output:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 01 Feb 2023 12:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

This appears to be a simple HTML document with a single heading that says "Hello World!".
